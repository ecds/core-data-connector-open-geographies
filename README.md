# CoreDataConnector::OpenGeographies

Short description and motivation.

## Usage

How to use my plugin.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "core_data_connector_open_geographies"
```

And then execute:

```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```bash
$ gem install core_data_connector_open_geographies
```

## Running Tests

Install/update migrations from CoreDataConnector

```bash
cd spec/dummy && \
bundle exec rails core_data_connector:install:migrations && \
bundle exec rails user_defined_fields:install:migrations && \
bundle exec rails fuzzy_dates:install:migrations && \
bundle exec rails triple_eye_effable:install:migrations && \
cd ../..
```

To run the tests:

```bash
bundle exec rspec spec/geojson.spec
```

## v1 API — example documents

Illustrative `search_data` output for the v1 (canonical/OG-compliant) indexer -
i.e. what a Place or Map Layer document looks like once a project uses the
exact relationship/UDF names from `canonical_template.json` and picks up the
`og.promote` shortcuts. Field values below are illustrative (some UUIDs are
made up), but the *shape* and the concrete numbers that could be pulled from
real data (the church's coordinates, the map layer's bbox) are real, taken
from production while building this out. A non-compliant project (e.g. the
existing HRCGA churches data, which uses names like "Categories" instead of
"Types") still indexes fully, just under its own raw relationship/UDF names
instead of these promoted ones - see `PromotedRelationships` for the
exact-match rule.

### Place

Fully fabricated - Atlanta, GA standing in for a real record - chosen so the
`media` array could show all five `media_type` options
(`image`/`video`/`audio`/`pano`/`model3d` per `canonical_template.json`'s
Media UDF) plus a spread of real-looking `identifiers`, neither of which the
actual HRCGA production data has examples of today.

Notes on what this demonstrates: `types` is a bare string array (taxonomy
promotions are names only, for faceting); `contained_in_place` and
`featured_media` are single objects; `media` and `map_layers` are arrays of
depth-limited summaries. `identifiers` shows the `sameAs`-style shape built
by `IDENTIFIER_URL_BUILDERS` - each authority's stored bare code (e.g. a
GeoNames numeric ID) turned into its canonical public URL.

`administrative_area` is deliberately a *different* thing from
`contained_in_place`, even though this example has both pointing at the same
real-world county. `contained_in_place` requires a curator to have actually
built a County place record and related it - a real local record with a
uuid/slug a client can link to. `administrative_area` needs no curator effort
at all: `V1::Place#extras` reverse-geocodes the place's own centroid against
GeoNames (`extendedFindNearbyJSON`, walking the full admin chain rather than
a fixed level so it isn't U.S.-specific) and caches the result in
`GeonamesHierarchy`, keyed on `place_id`, refetched only when the place's
geometry actually moves. Its entries are just facet-able names/IDs, not
local records - no uuid/slug, since there's nothing in the corpus to link to.
A project that never builds county records still gets basic geographic
faceting; one that does gets both.

The `media` array shows both branches of "exactly one of content urls or
embed URL must be present" from the canonical template's Media model: the
image is uploaded/IIIF-backed (`preview`/`thumbnail`/`content_url`/
`manifest_url`, from `V1::MediaContent#extras`), while the video, pano, and
3D model are externally hosted (`embed_url` only, from *UDF promotion*, not
`extras` - "Embed URL" is just a regular UDF on the Media project model that
happens to promote to a structural field, same mechanism as Map Layers'
`date`/`bearing`). `media_type`/`caption`/`alt_text`/`duration` are UDF
promotions too. The nested `media[0]` also shows one more level of expansion
(its own `creator`) - and that creator is *just* the flat envelope, with no
further relationships, because depth capping stops recursion there.

The `bbox` coordinates here are real - pulled from an actual production Place
geometry (`ST_XMin/XMax/YMin/YMax` over a real topographic-quad record) via
`V1::MapLayer#extras`, not invented. `date`/`bearing`/`source` come from
scalar UDF promotion (`"Source Type"` + `"Source URLs"` merge into one
`source: {type:, urls:}` object via the dotted `og.promote` path). `places`
is the *inverse* of a Place's `map_layers` relationship - it needs no
map-layer-specific code, since `related_to` already walks
`allow_inverse: true` relationships generically.

**Building these examples surfaced two mapping bugs, now fixed**: the nested
`places` object in both `es_mapping.json` and `es_mapping_map_layers.json`
was typed as `location: geo_point`, but the code actually produces
`geo: {point: {...}}` (matching `V1::Place#extras`) - fixed to match. The
nested `map_layers` object's `bbox` was typed `double`; it's actually a
geo_shape envelope object - fixed too.

**Not yet reconciled**: the nested `media` mapping property (in
`es_mapping.json`) expects `thumbnail_url`/`content_url`/`embed_url`/
`media_type`, but `V1::MediaContent#extras` actually produces
`preview`/`thumbnail`/`content_url`/`manifest_url` - some names match, some
don't, and `media_type`/`embed_url` are never populated by any current code
path. Left as-is pending a decision on which naming wins (the draft mapping's
or the already-implemented extras) rather than picking one silently.
